## Hello World!

Anyone who loves unique combinations?
How about mixing biology with software development and data engineering?

I am an emerging bioinformatics scientist, aiming towards processing complex biological data by:
- creating usable datasets
- developing tools to process them
- making them accessible for research

## Story behind me: 
### Chapter 1: Someone who has:
- MSc in Biology: molecular biology + bioinformatics
- deep interest applying computational methods on biological data
- the mindset to challenge herself

### Chapter 2: Experience in:
- developing full-stack website
- generating databases
- analysing diverse types of data (sequence, assay, term, image)
- working with several AI models to explore their capabilities and limitations

### Chapter 3: No scientist without research interest:
- everything related to RNA (localization, stability, gene regulation)
- spatial omics data
- microscopes and imaging
- genetic engineering and probe design

### Chapter 4: Currently gaining more knowledge in:
- Nextflow automation
- web/data security
- training/finetuning existing models for image segmentation
- polishing private repos to make them public

### Chapter 5: ???
