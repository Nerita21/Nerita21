## Hello World!🌍

Anyone who loves unique combinations?
How about mixing biology with programming and data analysis? 🧐

I am an emerging bioinformatics scientist, aiming towards processing complex biological data by:
- creating structured datasets
- developing analysis piplines
- making them accessible for research

## Story behind me: 
### Chapter 1: Someone who has:
- MSc in Biology: molecular biology + bioinformatics
- deep interest applying computational methods on biological data
- the mindset to challenge herself
- aim to follow FAIR data principles

### Chapter 2: Experience in:
- developing full-stack website
- generating database
- analysing diverse types of data (sequence, assay, term, image)
- working with several AI models to explore their capabilities and limitations

### Chapter 3: No scientist without research interest:
- RNA biology (localization, stability, gene regulation)
- spatial transcriptomics 
- microscopes and imaging
- genetic engineering and probe design

### Chapter 4: Currently gaining more knowledge in:
- Nextflow automation
- web/data security
- training/finetuning existing models for image segmentation
- polishing projectfor public release

### Chapter 5: ??? 👀
