## Hello Word! I'm Rita

Anyone who loves unique combinations?
How about mixing biology with software development and data engineering?

I am an emerging bioinformatics scientist, aiming towards processing complex biological data by:
- creating usable datasets
- developing tools to process it
- make accessible for research

## Story behind me: 
### Chapter 1: Someone who has:
- MSc in Biology: molecular biology + bioinformatics
- Deep interest applying computational methods on biological data
- The mindset to challenge herself

### Chapter 2: Experience in:
- Developing full stack website
- Generating databases
- Analysing diverse type of data (sequence, assay, term, image)
- Working with several AI model to obtain their limitations

### Chapter 3: No scientist without research interest:
- everything related to RNA (localization, stabiliy, gene regulation)
- spatial omics data
- microscopes and imaging
- genetic engineering and probe design

### Chapter 4: Currenty work on gaining more knowledge in:
- Nextflow automatisation
- Web/data security
- Training/finetuning exsisting models for image segmentation
